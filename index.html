            <h2 class="display-4">Federico Valverde Modrić's Successor</h2>
            <p>January 24, 2020</p>
            <p>In the last transfer window, there was a big interest from Real Madrid to purchase Manchester United's Paul Pogba, probably as a successor to the aging Luka Modrić. But after half of a season that he shows his importance to the team, no one has a doubt, Federico Valverde is the man to count on. It is not a secret that Real Madrid was afraid from the day they will need to replace Luka Modrić. The Croatian was one of Madrid's most important players during their European golden age, when they won 3 consecutive UEFA Champions League titles. Nevertheless, it seems that this time has come, Modrić is 34 now, and having a decrease in his ability. Madrid's manager, Zinedine Zidane wanted to sign Paul Pogba in the last transfer window, but since he failed to do so, he needed to find another solution to the problem, solution that will be known at a later time as Federico Valverde. Similar to Modrić, Valverde is a box to box midfielder, with high work rate in both defense and attack. On the defensive aspect of his game, Valverde is a great pressing player.<br /> 
              <button id="buttonRead0" src="" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm rounded-pill mt-2" onclick="displayArticle(0)">Read More...</button>
              <span id="span0"style="display: none;">Always the first to engage for defensive duels from Real's midfield, and prevent the opposition from enjoying ball possession without being pressed. In addition, like Modrić, Valverde excel when it comes to intercept opposition passes. Another defensive aspect of Fede's game is his ability to cover the defenders. Integral part of Zizou's tactic is based on fullbacks movement to support the attacking gameplay. While the fullbacks go forward, they leave behind them lots of space the opposition could exploit for counter attacks. Valverde's ability to cover the defenders allows the fullbacks to do a lot of attacking runs in the team's flanks without being afraid of opposition counter attacks. When it comes to his attacking aspect of his game, Valverde's biggest weapon is his ability bring the ball forward. Using his dribbling skills, lethal first touch and bursting power, Valverde became one of the most important players in Real Madrid's transition game. It's seen often after he make an interception or a tackle and right away making a progressive run towards the opposition goal. The 21 years old international Uruguayan is not a typical young player. Showing tremendous maturity in his game, Valverde became one of Madrid's best players this season. His decision-making ability is something special for a player at his age. We could see an example for it in the last Supercup final against Atletico Madrid, when he decides to tackle Morata, and prevent a 1 on 1 chance in the 115th minute, knowing it will cost him with a red card. All in all, Valverde showed this season that he is Real Madrid's successor for Luka Modrić. With great performances this season, he is one of the main reasons the team have the best defense in the league, and for their position at the table, equal to the points of the rivals from Barcelona.

            <h2 class="display-4">Gareth Bales future at Real Madrid</h2>
            <p>July 24, 2019</p>
            <p>There are a lot of different views on the Welshman. Never the less, we should all be grateful for what he has done for our club. Most likely his most popular moment at Real, was his goal against Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey final. The goal he scores is most likely one of the most famous moments in an El Clasico match. Then Bale went on to score two winning goals in two different Champions League finals. Some people want Bale to stay in Madrid to finish his career and others do not. The more likely situation to happen is Real Madrid will sell Bale before the summer ends, before we discuss some possible moves, where exactly did Gareths career take a turn in the opposite direction of where we wanted? Gareth has been involved with 167 goals, scoring 102 of them, and assisting 65. Gareth played 231 matches for the white and for how many goals he has been involved with these really aren't terrible sats. So if being a player that can help provide goals what is the problem with keeping the forward?<br />
              <button id="buttonRead1" src="" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm rounded-pill mt-2" onclick="displayArticle(1)">Read More...</button>
              <span id="span1"style="display: none;">The most goals Bale has scored in a singular season is 19, but he has had around 25 reported injuries in his career, which means he has had more injuries than he has had goals in his best season for Madrid. As said before, Gareth played 231 matches, because of injuries Bale missed 70 games for Real Madrid. He also missed 21 matches while playing for the Spurs during the earlier days of his career. Due to all these injuries, he was out for a total of 531 days. The biggest injury he had caused him to be out for 84 days during the 2016/17 season. The ankle injury undoubtedly caused him to lose the form he had prior to that. He received the Injury in late November, after his amazing campaign for the Euro 2016, where he led Wales to third place. You can see after this injury he was never the player he used to be. It also does not help the fact that Zidane does not seem to be the biggest fan of Gareth. Zidane simply doesn't like the attitude that Bale would have during the seasons. Zidane said during a press conference “it'd be better if bale leaves tomorrow” and insists its nothing personal between Gareth and him. In defense of Zidane, he is most likely thinking for the future of the club and for Bale there's a chance it would be better for him to leave and receive a better opportunity for another club. Saying this what are some possible clubs for Real to sell Gareth to. There have been talks about a surprising swap with PSG star Neymar, which goes into another topic has been labeled the solution to Zidane's problems. The more talked about move is selling Gareth back to Spurs, where if there could be a possible swap deal with the Danish playmaker Christian Eriksen, even if a swap deal was not an option selling Bale back to Spurs may be the most realistic option. China is the final option for a move, The Chinese Super League likes to spend big money on stars and there's a very high chance that if there's an offer from China Madrid will take the first chance they get. The final option is Bale staying. One of our young stars Marco Asensio tore his ACL in a pre-season match against Arsenal, this gap needs to be filled. Including Bale, we have many options and there is a chance we would keep the forward for another season to see how it plays out keeping him longer than what was expected. Even if he does not stay for another season we should be expecting big-money bids from clubs for the Welshman. We, of course, want the best for him and his career, but the club comes first before any player that we have. Zidane realizes this, and we should all be patient with the clubs decision even though it is reported there will be an answer on Bales future within the week. Whatever happens, we should all be grateful for how lucky we are to of had Bale and the impact he has had on the team.

            <h2 class="display-4">The Future of Madrid</h2>
            <p>July 23, 2019</p>
            <p>An underrated thing that Madrid has been overlooked for is the fact of how well we do of bringing in young talents, saying this what could we expect in the next five years or so? First off is our defense, For the left-back position, we have two options considering that Sergio reguilón comes back from his season loan from Sevilla. Besides Sergio, we had an amazing chance to sign World Cup winner Ferland Mendy. Ferland played at Lyon for about two years until we signed him on a six-year deal for €48 million. Ferland and Sergio both have the potential to become the two of best left backs in the world with how consistent they are on the pitch. Sergio played very well under Lopetegui and Solari, and him being gone for a loan at Sevilla who finished 6th in Laliga for the 2018/19 season may be a great opportunity for himself, and Ferland to get used to the squad and coaching staff. Then onto Center back we have another World Cup winner Raphael Varane.<br />
              <button id="buttonRead2" src="" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm rounded-pill mt-2" onclick="displayArticle(2)">Read More...</button>
              <span id="span2"style="display: none;">Varane is twenty-six and he will most definitely still have some more years in him for the future squad, Varane has had a great career at Madrid and we shouldn't expect anything less than that in the near future. He’s a very reliable player and very consistent which makes him one of the world greatest center backs. His future partner, Éder Militão was bought for €50 million from FC Porto. There are some high hopes for the twenty-one year old. During the Copa América, Militão was not starting, however, he was still getting minutes and for his age in the tournament at only twenty-one that is still very impressive especially considering that Brazil went on to win the tournament again Peru. He did pass his physical test but while at the Bernabéu, during a press conference, he started to feel dizzy and light-headed and had to cut the conference short. Healthwise this shouldn't have any sort of impact on him, for all we know he could have been very nervous and overwhelmed. Hopefully, only good things will come from our new center back in the near future. Last but not least for our line of defence we have Álvaro Odriozola. Possibly one of the best signings we have had in a few years, we bought Álvaro from Real Sociedad for around €30 million at the beginning of the 2018 season. possibly one of the fastest players on our team he makes a perfect right back, along with his great vision and ability to make space for crosses. Our goalkeeper situation is in good hands; no pun intended. We have Golden Glove winner Thibaut Courtois who will most likely be our starter in the future. Thibaut is only twenty-seven and hopefully in the next few years will be in great condition as he is now. Then for a backup, we have Andriy Lunin who is twenty years old who had a loan at CD Leganés for the 2018 season, but Zidane is reportedly keen on another season loan for the young Ukrainian Keeper. Our midfield should be set, maybe a few new signings along the way but really we should be good with our current youth and players. All of our youngsters are very promising, Brahim Díaz who is 19 started his career at Manchester City was bought for €17 million for such a young player he has such amazing vision and passing. He will definitely be a player to watch in the next few years. Another attacking Midfielder of ours is young Takefusa Kubo. Kubo was recently brought to Madrid, and during his youth career played for Barcelona and is not afraid to let everyone know that Real Madrid is the best club in the world. At the age of eighteen, he was brought up to Japans National team from their U-23 squad. Dani Ceballos who is reportedly going on a loan to Arsenal always shines whenever he gets the chance to play under Zidane, even for the Spain national team the ball is glued to his feet if given the right opportunities he can definitely become a key player for us on the pitch. Recently one of our star youth joined Atlético Madrid, Marcos Llorente joined the red side of Madrid for £35 Million. His departure definitely left an open gap in our future squad but hopefully, it can be filled by our Uruguayan defensive midfielder Federico Valverde. Valverde can learn a lot, especially from the gifted midfield we have now, he most definitely will have a role on our team in the future as he has the potential to become an amazing defensive midfielder. After the departure of Cristiano, our entire attacking has been a mess. We have had no player that could consistently provide goals. Our luck may change, we signed Luka Jović from Eintracht Frankfurt for €60 million on a six-year contract. He would be our main striker, then for our wings, we have multiple options. The first option is Eden Hazard, who came to Madrid this summer after the long-awaited arrival for the playmaker, he and Luka will make a great duo, Eden will hopefully be able to provide a lot of assists and goals this season alongside Luka. Eden is twenty-eight but he will definitely have quite a few years with Real, especially considering this is his dream club, Eden should be staying around for a while. Then a signing from last season, Vinícius Júnior has had a chance to play with our first team and even though he didn't have a lot of goals or assists he plays with heart and is a very passionate player we will hopefully have for a long time. You, of course, cannot forget about Marco Asensio, he has been with us for a few years and even scored in the champions league final a few years ago against Juventus. He has had a lot of goals and a lot of opportunities and he is a player we will be holding onto for a long time. Last but certainly not least, this player scored a beautiful free-kick on his debut against Bayern Munich that social media went crazy for. Rodrygo is an eighteen-year-old who is ruthless of the goal and without question will be scoring a lot of goals, the speed and accuracy that he has, is deadly to any opposing team that we face especially at such a young age, think of what he will be capable of in the next 5 years or so. Hopefully, in the next few seasons, we can begin to expect many more trophies as we are used to winning.

            <h2 class="display-4">Summer Changes</h2>
            <p>April 27, 2019</p>
            <p>For most fans, I think we can agree when we say that the season has been beyond slow and painful. Hopefully, things are going to change especially with the ginormous budget Perez gave Zidane of 300£. Here are some changes we should be expecting this summer. Who to Buy: Hazard- For how many little hints to Zidane being his idol as a child and Madrid being his dream club I wouldn't be surprised at all if he ends up joining in the summer. I do think he would be a great signing for us to get back on our feet. (Left Wing/Striker) Luka jović- Frankfurt director (Fredi Bobic) reports this transfer as ‘a real possibility’, the Serbian Striker has been eyeing a move to the club and has 26 goals in all appearances this season. The signing of him would mean no return for de Tomás. The Spanish International has been on a loan at Rayo Vallecano for the past season and has 14 goals over 30 appearances in La Liga.<br />
              <button id="buttonRead3" src="" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm rounded-pill mt-2" onclick="displayArticle(3)">Read More...</button>
              <span id="span3"style="display: none;">              (Striker) Christian Eriksen- Having 151 career assists and a £150m target on his back for Real Madrid, are looking to potentially sign the Denmark playmaker but personally to me this seems more unlikely than Jović and Hazard but would still be an amazing signing for us. (Attacking Midfield) Jadon Sancho- Zidane is unsure whether or not he wants to sign the youngster. Jadon would cause roughly £100m. Personally, I don’t find that this is worth it, because of our signing of Brahim Díaz I think that we would have more dead weight on the team. (Right Wing) Loans & Transfers: Martin Ødergaard- The Norwegian midfielder has been on a season-long loan at Vitesse and has provided 9 goals and 6 assists in 29 matches, however for this younger the stats don’t say everything about him. He’s very quick on the ball with amazing vision and will be very helpful in the future for the club if Zidane decides not to put him on another loan or to sell him. Martin felt little confidence under Zidane's hard and intense training because of his age, but this can be resolved with time and patience which Zidane hopefully gives him. (Attacking Midfield) James Rodríguez- James is arguably one of the best attacking midfielders in the world and has been at Bayern Munich on a two-year-long loan and is keen on staying there. He has never had the best relationship with Zidane because he has always preferred Isco over him. (Attacking Midfield) Theo Hernández- Theo has been put on a loan to Real Sociedad for the season. We most likely won’t need a reason to want to have him back at Madrid, Sergio Reguilón who played under Solari during Marcelos 55 days of injuries (muscle injury, torn muscle bundle, and muscle strain) proved to be our future left back in many ways and will undoubtedly be the heir to Marcelo. (Left Back) Thibaut Courtois- Zidane has been saying he prefers Navas over him and after only one year or having him Zidane is ready to let him go. I think it’s possible he’ll go out on a loan but it seems more likely that we will end up selling The Golden GLove Winner. (Goal Keeper) Wasted Talent: Marcos Llorente- Zidane has never given him enough playing time as a lot of people think he deserves. He played incredibly well under Solari until he sustained a groin injury, Zidane most likely will not sell him or loan but Marcos will most likely remain on the bench for the next couple seasons. (Defensive Midfield/ Center Midfield) Jesús Vallejo- Vallejo has been injury prone while playing at Madrid. He sustained 3 hamstring injuries in the span of 6 months causing him to be out for 99 days. He wasn’t only injury prone at Madrid, he has had 14 injuries in his career 13 of them being muscle related to the legs. In total, he has missed 407 days because of injuries and he will doubtfully still be at Madrid in the next couple of seasons. There's simply no reason to keep someone that sustains injuries so easily and frequently. (Center Back) Dani Ceballos- Dani is a very simple case, Zidane just hasn't given him a lot of playing time and his time at Madrid is running out simply because Zidane doesn't see a fit for him in the squad. (Center Midfield) Mariano- Mariano has played 17 games and has provided 2 goals with no assists, he is getting no playing time over Benzema or Vinícius Júnior. He most likely won't be sold or loaned and will probably just be used as a reserved and substitute which will be good to give our starting strikers a break. (Left Wing/ Striker) Written by Zaden W.

            <h2 class="display-4">A Brief Look into Real Madrid’s Summer Window Transfer Targets Ryan Rogers</h2>
            <p>May 30, 2019</p>
            <p>As a Madrid fan, transfer rumours aren’t something you see flair up out of nowhere when the summer rolls around. They are an everyday occurrence, something apart of the club’s DNA due to its history, trophies, and consistent quest for greatness in Europe. Galacticos have come and gone, bringing trophies with them and eventually leaving as legends. At the turn of the century, newly appointed President, Florentino Perez, implemented a new transfer policy with the goal of bringing in the world’s biggest stars to bring Real Madrid back to the peak of European glory. The same occurred in 2009 when Perez bought Benzema, Ronaldo, and Kaka to be the catalysts of a new Galactico Era. With the 2018/19 season winding down and the transfer rumours in full swing, I think it’s fair to say that Madridistas could be about to witness a Summer revolution similar to that of 2009.<br />
              <button id="buttonRead4" src="" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm rounded-pill mt-2" onclick="displayArticle(4)">Read More...</button>
              <span id="span4"style="display: none;">              The cause for this summer shakeup is rather discouraging as Madrid suffered through one of their worst seasons in recent history, seeing record low attendances and heavy fan criticism off the field as well as early exits in the Champions League, Copa del Rey, and La Liga Title race on the field. The negativity around the club and the embarrassingly poor results have appeared to ruffle up Perez’s feathers and he’s ready to break the bank to bring in a new wave of talent. After the Europa League Final, Eden Hazard all but confirmed the upcoming move to the Bernabeu that many fans have been hoping for. Hazard has made his love of Madrid and Zidane no secret this past 12 months and it looks like he will finally be the man in the famous 7 kit next season. Journalists at AS claim Hazard should be announced this upcoming Monday once the final details are worked out. In his midweek interview, Perez also seemed to confirm our interest in Luka Jovic, the young Serbian striker that has taken the Bundesliga and Europa League by storm this season. A powerful player with a great finish and the ability to distribute is certainly something Madrid could use as Karim Benzema isn’t getting any younger, despite a great season. If things go to plan, expect a 60 to 70 Euros fee to be agreed upon in the coming weeks with the Serb arriving as the heir apparent to Benzema’s throne. Zidane has taken the left back situation into his own hands as he doesn’t rate Reguilon as well as many fans and analysts do. Expect a new contract and loan for the young left back following the arrival of Ferland Mendy from Lyon. His deal also appears to be reaching its conclusion and Mendy will more than likely be competing with Marcelo for minutes next season. The last rumoured position of interest is that of central midfield. Modric’s legs are finally catching up to him but he will still receive a one-year contract extension for winning the Balon D’Or. Modric is a great leader and certainly someone worth keeping around however, a new midfielder that can change the course of a game is needed to fill his aging shoes. Christian Eriksen, Paul Pogba, Tanguy Ndombele, and Giovani Lo Celso are all rumoured targets and we should expect to see one arrive this summer to share Modric’s load as well as bring goals from midfield. With Eder Militao and the flashy Rodrygo Goes already confirmed arrivals this Summer, Perez has shown that poor seasons will not be tolerated and positive change will come. This very well could be a new beginning for Real Madrid, with Zidane and Perez at the helm. As a fan, do not expect immediate greatness next season as things almost never click immediately. But be prepared for a revolution this Summer that will surely be the beginning step in a new trophy-laiden Madrid era.
